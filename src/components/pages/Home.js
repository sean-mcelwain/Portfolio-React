            <p> I began my professional career as a civil litigation attorney in Kansas City.  After four
          years of practice I elected to pursue a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering emphasizing in 
          Electrical and Computer Engineering with the eventual goal of eligibility to practice patent law. 
          Pursuant to this goal, and the potential to practice software engineering patent law, I enrolled in
          The University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp Program to obtain a basic programming foundation to further build
          upon in the future.  <br /><br />

          Throughout my engineering studies, I have continued to practice law in my prior capacity.  However, I am 
          currently interested in employment opportunities to expand my programming skillset on my journey to transition my career
          to patent law.
